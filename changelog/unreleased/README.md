# Unreleased

Changes since v0.1.5. The version number is assigned at release, when this folder is renamed.

- [2026-07-31] Tooling: each Release now attaches exactly one artifact per target — a flat installer bundle sealing the native installer, the program payload and its checksum — serving online and offline installation from the same file, with mandatory checksums at both layers, no more raw archives or `*-offline` wrappers, and hermetic installer tests in CI; the Windows payload drops its policy-blocked `penguin.ps1` launcher and the installer broadcasts the user-Path change so new terminal windows find `penguin`. ([details](2026-07-31-unified-installer-artifact.md))

- [2026-07-31] Backward compatibility: the batch's compat decisions in one place — installers keep a content-probed legacy path so pre-0.1.6 releases and old local archives stay installable (with its removal owner named), old saved installer scripts break loudly against new assets by design, the dropped `penguin.ps1` launcher cleans itself up on upgrade, and the truncated-output batch is additive with nothing to migrate. ([details](2026-07-31-backward-compatibility.md))

- [2026-07-31] Core: tool output that exceeds `maxOutputLength` in an Agent Session is now saved to the Session scratchpad and the recovery path appended to the same truncated result the model and frontends see — no new tool, no change to the visible cap or the stream-equals-complete contract — wired through one generic `EnvironmentConfig.sessionScratchpadDir` parameter, with per-call 8 MiB bounds and UTF-8-safe head/tail for larger calls; every model-visible path core composes (prompt Environment lines, attachment lines, goal file, recovery notes) now shares one forward-slash spelling on Windows via `modelVisiblePath`. ([details](2026-07-31-recover-truncated-tool-output.md))

- [2026-07-31] Evaluation Center: Case details separate Target Agent task materials from project-member-visible scoring rubrics, Score charts use a padded dynamic axis without discarding stored values, and the benchmark Skills write YAML-safe Scoreboard summaries. ([details](2026-07-31-evaluation-center-case-details.md))

- [2026-07-30] Web App: the main conversation's file summary moves to the completed Task boundary — one card per Task scanning all of its assistant text, nested agent conversations keep their per-message summaries, and file-existence caching stops retaining negative results so a later Task can surface a newly created path. ([details](2026-07-30-file-summary-task-boundary.md))

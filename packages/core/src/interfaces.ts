/**
 * Internal SDK interface contracts: LLM, Environment.
 *
 * `context_engine` only handles OmniMessage; protocol conversion and concrete implementations
 * are each interface's own responsibility.
 * Human is not an "interface/class with methods" but the SDK's input/output boundary itself:
 * output is streamed by `Session.run()` as an async generator, and input is delivered via
 * `run`'s `RunOptions` — approvals are requested one at a time through the injected `approve`
 * callback, and interruption goes through `signal`. Hence no Human interface is defined here.
 *
 * These types form the foundational contract shared by all units; implementing units integrate
 * against them.
 *
 * Docs: packages/docs/content/interfaces.{zh,en}.md (site path /docs/interfaces) explains each
 * contract and its extension seams — keep the page in sync when changing signatures here.

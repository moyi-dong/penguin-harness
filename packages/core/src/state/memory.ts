/**
 * Workspace Memory: the Agent's long-term notes across Sessions.
 *
 * Memory keeps what cannot be re-derived from the current Workspace or its code history —
 * user feedback, project decisions, working conventions, entry points into external systems.
 * It is **not** context compaction: compaction preserves one Session's short-term working
 * state, Memory preserves what later Sessions need.
 *
 * Scope is `Project + Agent + Workspace`: Sessions of the same Agent in the same Workspace
 * share one Memory; different Workspaces of one Agent keep their topic files apart but share
 * a single index; different Agents never share Memory even in the same Workspace. Memory lives
 * in Agent State, so it travels with export / import / snapshots and is visible to every
 * Project member who can reach the Agent — which is why there is no `user` topic type here.
 *
 * On-disk layout (`agent_state/memory/`):
 *
 *     memory/
 *     ├── AGENTS.md                    # the single index, grouped by workspace key
 *     └── <workspace_key>/
 *         ├── .workspace               # the Workspace path this key stands for
 *         └── <topic>.md               # frontmatter + body, semantic topics (not per Task/date)
 *
 * The Harness only decides *where* Memory lives, keeps writes inside that directory, and
 * injects the index into the prompt; the model owns the semantics — what is worth keeping,
 * how topics are split, and how the index is maintained — using the ordinary file tools.
 * Docs: /docs/configuration § "Workspace Memory".

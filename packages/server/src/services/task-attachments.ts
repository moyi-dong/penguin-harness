/**
 * Composer file attachments — the `{type:"file"}` variant of TaskInputPart.
 *
 * The browser has no Session while a chat is still a draft, so there is no upload endpoint to
 * call before sending: the file rides the task request itself as a base64 `data:` URL, exactly
 * like a pasted image does. On the way in it is written to the **Session scratchpad**
 * (`<agent>/scratchpad/<sessionId>/`, deleted with the Session, so cleanup is free) and the
 * message text gains one `[attached file: <absolute path>]` line per file — the bytes never
 * enter the conversation, the model opens the file by path with its ordinary file tools.
 *
 * The line format and its placement are not defined here: they are shared with core's
 * `[attached image: …]` producer and the Web renderer that parses both
 * (`@prismshadow/penguin-core/markers` → attachment-lines.ts, plus `appendAttachmentLines`),
 * so the two conventions cannot drift apart.
